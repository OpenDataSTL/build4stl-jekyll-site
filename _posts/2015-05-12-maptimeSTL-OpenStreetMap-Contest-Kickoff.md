Join us at the [May 12th maptimeSTL meetup](http://www.meetup.com/maptimeSTL/events/222435942/) to learn about [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and kick off two friendly mapping competitions - complete with mappy trophies and bragging rights for an entire year!

Can't make it to maptimeSTL in person? No problem! As long as you live in the St. Louis area, you can still take part in the competitions - and you can follow [@maptimeSTL](https://twitter.com/maptimestl) on twitter for updates and tips for beginner mappers. 

### 1. Greatest Number of Edits

We'll be awarding a trophy at the Build for STL hackathon to the person who makes the greatest number of edits to OSM between May 12th at 6:30pm (maptimeSTL meetup time!) and midnight on May 30th. 

In order for your edits to count, please include #Build4STL and/or #maptimeSTL in your commit message when you save them.

### 2. Best #OSMSelfie

If quantity of edits isn't your thing, we'll also be awarding a trophy to the person with the best #OSMSelfie. An [#OSMSelfie](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Be%20A%20Mapper/diary/26355) is a photo of you next to something you added to or changed in OSM and a link to the OSM edit you made. Map something interesting, take a photo, and bragging rights could be yours!

For your #OSMSelfie to count, you'll have to do two things: first, include #Build4STL and/or #maptimeSTL in your commit message when you save your edit. Then, share your photo and the link to your edit with maptimeSTL via [twitter](https://twitter.com/maptimestl) or our [meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/maptimeSTL/). Share as many #OSMSelfies as you want starting May 12th at 6:30 and ending at midnight on May 30th - and contribute early and often!
