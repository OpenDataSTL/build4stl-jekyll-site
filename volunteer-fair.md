The Build for STL Volunteer Fair will be held Friday, May 29th, from 4 pm to 6 pm in the [555 Building](/555Building). This technology and design volunteer fair will immediately precede the kickoff of the weekend-long Hackathon.
 The volunteer fair aims to connect local St. Louis non-profit organizations with developers/programmers/designers/technologists interested in volunteering for specific organizations or causes.

Additionally, if you will be attending the Hackathon, the volunteer fair is a great way to start generating ideas about what apps, websites, or tools could help make St. Louis better.

Space at the volunteer fair is free for non-profit organizations! Please fill out this form so that we know to expect you:
