###Evaluate how your local government is doing on creating good digital services. Participate in the [Local Digital Service Census](https://service-census.herokuapp.com/) to survey the quality and usability of the 10 most-searched for city services, as identified from research from Code for America Tech Team.
  
##BACKGROUND / CONTEXT  
  
For many residents today, the city or county website is their first stop to access important public services and information — from paying a parking ticket to searching for government jobs. But many municipalities still have work to do to make key services accessible and usable online. By evaluating how your local government is doing on creating good digital services, you can help us better understand the state of digital government across the country and identify the biggest areas to make a difference in 2015.

The Local Digital Services Census surveys the quality and usability of the 10 most-searched for city services, as identified from research from Code for America Tech Team.

By participating in the census, you’ll help your Brigade, local government, and Code for America:

- Create a baseline of what’s working and what’s not with online city services
- Assess and prioritize city services
- Engage local government and community partners in a conversation about building 21st century government
